AI development guide for the workouts application.

## Project Overview

This is a minimalist, mobile-first workout timer application built with React 19 + TypeScript. The app operates entirely client-side with a focus on reliability, high-contrast UI, and comprehensive audio/vibration feedback.

## Architecture & Development Guidelines

### Core Principles

- **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal working solution, avoid premature features
- **Clear Boundaries**: Separate external concerns from domain logic using React Context
- **KISS Principle**: Only add complexity when there's immediate need
- **SOLID Patterns**: Follow separation of concerns, each screen manages its own timer

### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/screens/    # Main app screens (ConfigScreen, ExerciseScreen, RestScreen, BetweenSetsScreen, CompleteScreen)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/ui/         # Reusable UI components (CircularTimer, ProgressBar, Button)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/             # React Context providers (WorkoutProvider, WorkoutContext)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                # Custom React hooks (useTimer, useAudio, useVibration, useOnMountUnsafe)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                # Pure utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                # TypeScript definitions
```

### Code Style & Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, explicit interfaces for component props
- **React Patterns**: Custom hooks for stateful logic, context for state management
- **Functions**: Descriptive names, single responsibility principle
- **Imports**: Organize external/internal, destructure when possible
- **Comments**: Only add when explicitly requested by user

### Design System

- **Component Consistency**: Reusable UI components maintain identical visual presentation across contexts; never use boolean props to toggle visual styles
- **Animation Standards**: Use CSS animations from `index.css`; screen transitions get `animate-fade-in`, important content gets `animate-scale-in`
- **Button Enhancement**: All buttons automatically receive `transition-all duration-200 ease-out` and should include `hover:scale-105 active:scale-95` for tactile feedback
- **Timing Functions**: Always `ease-out` for natural motion

### Critical Implementation Details

- **React StrictMode**: App runs in StrictMode causing double execution in development
- **useOnMountUnsafe Hook**: Custom hook prevents double execution using ref-based pattern
- **Timer Management**: Each screen manages its own timer instance, uses refs to avoid re-renders
- **State Updates**: Use setTimeout(fn, 0) to break synchronous update chains and prevent "Cannot update component while rendering" errors
- **Component Design**: Avoid prop-based styling (e.g., `isExercise`). Let context provide visual differentiation

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Development Protocol

1. **Always run after code changes**: `npm run typecheck` ‚Üí `npm run lint` ‚Üí `npm run build`
2. **Test UI changes**: Use MCP Playwright browser testing before committing
3. **Audio testing**: Verify in real browser (dev server audio can be unreliable)
4. **Mobile testing**: Verify wake lock and touch interactions on actual devices
5. **Format before commits**: `npm run format`

### Quick Testing Setup

**Test URL**: `http://localhost:5173/workouts/?exercises=Push-ups%2CSquats&exerciseTime=15&restTime=15`

- Pre-configured with 2 exercises and 15-second timers for rapid testing
- Always test at least 2 complete sets to verify full workout flow

## Testing & Validation

### Console Debugging Protocol

Always monitor browser console for these key logs:

```
üöÄ STARTING WORKOUT: { exercises: [...], totalSegments: N, exerciseDuration: X, restDuration: Y }
‚úÖ EXERCISE COMPLETE: ExerciseName (index: N, segment: X‚ÜíY)
üîÑ REST COMPLETE: transitioning to NextExercise (segment: X‚ÜíY)
üéØ SET N COMPLETE - transitioning to between sets
‚è±Ô∏è BETWEEN SETS: 30s break before Set N+1
üèÅ WORKOUT COMPLETE: N sets finished
```

**Error Monitoring**:

- No "Cannot update component while rendering" errors
- Exercise index stays within bounds (0 to N-1 for N exercises)
- Segment index progresses correctly (0 to 2N-1 for N exercises)

### User Acceptance Testing

#### Core Workflow Validation

1. **Configuration Screen**: Verify exercise list, drag & drop, time dropdowns, "Start Workout" button
2. **Exercise Phase**: Orange background, exercise name, 250px unified timer, progress bar, pause/resume, audio cues (halfway beep, countdown), vibration, auto-transition
3. **Rest Phase**: Dark background, "Rest" heading, "Up next: [Exercise]", "Set N" indicator, 250px unified timer (structural symmetry with exercise screen), countdown audio, auto-transition
4. **Between Sets**: Dark background, "Set N Complete!", 250px unified timer, set completion audio/vibration, auto-transition to next set
5. **Completion**: Final message, sets completed summary, elapsed time, "New Workout" button

#### Critical Edge Cases Checklist

- ‚úÖ Empty exercise list disables "Start Workout"
- ‚úÖ Single exercise (no rest periods)
- ‚úÖ End workout during any phase
- ‚úÖ Pause/resume functionality in all timer states
- ‚úÖ Browser refresh during active workout
- ‚úÖ Audio works when browser is muted
- ‚úÖ Wake lock prevents screen sleep
- ‚úÖ Progress bar accuracy with odd/even exercise counts
- ‚úÖ LocalStorage persistence across sessions
- ‚úÖ URL encoding/decoding with special characters

### Playwright Browser Testing

When using MCP Playwright for automated browser testing and screenshots:

#### Critical Rules

- **NEVER use arbitrary time delays** (`browser_wait_for` with `time` parameter) - The back-and-forth between LLM and browser introduces unpredictable latency that can cause screens to change mid-capture
- **ALWAYS wait for specific UI changes** - Use `browser_wait_for` with `text` or `textGone` parameters to wait for screen transitions
  - Example: Wait for "Up next:" text to appear when transitioning from exercise to rest
  - Example: Wait for "Set 1 Complete!" heading when transitioning to between sets screen

#### Screenshot Management

- **Default location**: `.playwright-mcp` (automatically created by Playwright MCP)
- **Naming convention**: Use sequential, descriptive names `01-config.png`, `02-exercise.png`, `03-rest.png`, `04-between-sets.png`, `05-complete.png`
- **Mobile viewport**: Always resize browser with `browser_resize` before testing (e.g., 375x667 for iPhone SE). This is a mobile only application.

#### Workflow Testing Example

```
1. Navigate to test URL with 15s timers (allows time for LLM/browser communication)
2. Take screenshot of config screen
3. Click "Start Workout"
4. Take screenshot of exercise screen (orange background)
5. Wait for "Up next:" text (NOT arbitrary delay)
6. Take screenshot of rest screen (dark background)
7. Wait for next exercise name in heading
8. Take screenshot of second exercise
9. Wait for "Set 1 Complete!" text
10. Take screenshot of between sets screen
11. Click "End Workout"
12. Take screenshot of completion screen
```

## Technical Implementation

### Required APIs & Libraries

- **Audio**: Web Audio API (no external libraries like Tone.js)
- **Wake Lock**: Navigator.wakeLock API with fallback handling
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage + URL query params (not hash)
- **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 API (no external libraries)

### Known Issues & Solutions

- **React StrictMode Double Execution**: Use `useOnMountUnsafe` hook to prevent timer double-start
- **Synchronous State Updates**: Use `setTimeout(fn, 0)` to defer state updates and prevent render errors
- **Audio Reliability**: Test in real browser, not just dev server
- **Mobile Wake Lock**: Verify on actual devices, not browser dev tools

### State Management Architecture

- **WorkoutContext**: Central state management using React Context API
- **Screen Independence**: Each screen component manages its own timer instance
- **Ref Pattern**: Use refs to store latest function references and prevent effect re-runs
- **Segmented Progress**: Progress tracking uses discrete segments (2N-1 for N exercises) instead of time-based calculations

## Documentation Maintenance

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: After any major change or feature addition, review and update:

- [@README.md](README.md) for user-facing changes
- [@SPECIFICATIONS.md](SPECIFICATIONS.md) for design/feature changes
- [@CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for architectural/development changes

## Development Focus

This frontend-only application prioritizes:

- **Reliability over features**: Robust core functionality before adding complexity
- **Mobile experience over desktop**: Touch-first design, wake lock, PWA support
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Clear code patterns, minimal dependencies
